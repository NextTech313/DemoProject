	/*When we talk about Method OverRiding, Inheritance comes in to play. Inheritance is the 
	 * process to get properties from one class to another. Which means, getting the properties from 
	 * parent class to child class(using the extends keyword). We all know that by creating an 
	 * object of the class we could get the property. Creating an Object means - just getting the 
	 * instance of a class- which means you have to call the properties from the parent class for 
	 * it to show up or else it wont. However, Inheritance means as if all the properties are already
	 * in the child class. (Inheritance happens based on "IS A" relationship)
